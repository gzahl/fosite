CONFIGURATION & COMPILATION

Although all source files have the extension .f90 the code uses some
FORTRAN 95 extensions and therefore only compiles with a Fortran 95
compiler.
To customize the build process enter the directory with the source code
and run

   ./configure

For a list of command line arguments of the configure script type

   ./configure --help

The configure-script should find and set the variables FC, FCFLAGS and LDFLAGS.
FC should point to your Fortran 95 compiler and FCFLAGS should contain some
appropriate command line arguments for the compile command.
These variables can be manually set by typing

   ./configure FC=<your compiler>

<your compiler> can be sxf90, ifort, g95, mpif90, gfortran, etc.
Then type

   make

at the command line to build the fosite library and all example simulations
in the examples subdirectory. These are just executable programs linked against
the fosite library.
If one enters

   make check

an automatic test suite is run, which can take quite a while.
More information about fosite, e.g. parallel builds, customizations and much more
can be found in the

   doc/

directory. A good starting point is the mainpage.dox text file. If doxygen is
installed, a full fledged source documentation can be generated with the help
of the doc/Makefile.

with this.
